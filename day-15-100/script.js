/* Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, {  }. 
For example, the following code defines a simple function named square: */

function sqaure(numbers){
    return number * number;
}

/* The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function consists of one statement
 that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return 
 statement specifies the value returned by the function, which is number * number.*/

function print(){
    console.log('Hello');
    console.log(2 + 2);
}
print();
